"If one of the APCu or WinCache cache systems is present on the server, it "
"will be automatically used by GLPI. The system is based on Symfony Cache."

"This distinction makes it possible to avoid storing the translation cache on"
" a network, which could produce too many requests on the network and "
"ultimately have a negative impact."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/advanced/cache.rst:21
msgid ""
"Conversely, the database cache should be on the network in case of multiple "
"front-ends."

"In order to allow you to refine the settings, or to use another cache "
"system, a manual solution is proposed. To take advantage of it, add to the "
"``glpi_configs`` table a ``cache_db`` and/or ``cache_trans`` key for the "
"``core`` context and adapt the value according to what you want."

"If you install several instances of GLPI on the same server, the cache "

"In order to exclude the font files from the cache, all you have to do is "
"enter their full path in a blacklist file for opcache. The path to this file"

"( ``/etc/php.d/opcache-glpi.blacklist`` for example under Fedora). If your "
"GLPI instance is in the folder ``/var/www/``, the path to exclude will be "
