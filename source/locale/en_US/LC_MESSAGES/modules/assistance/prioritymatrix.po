"ITIL best practices separate urgency (as defined by the user) from incident "
"impact (a user, a service, a functionality...) which is usually set by the "
"technician. A matrix is then used to compute the priority associated to the "
"item of the help desk (ticket, problem or change) as a function of both "
"urgency and impact. GLPI provides a default predefined matrix which "
"corresponds to standard cases."

"This predefined matrix can be modified in tab `Assistance` of menu **Setup >"

"Knowing that the order of items processing by technicians is based on "
"priority, it is possible to select the different levels of urgency, impact "
"or priorities that will be used in the help desk and to disable some of "
"them. This action allows to ease declaration of an incident and its "
"processing. To disable a level, this level must be set to `No`. Medium level"
" cannot be disabled."

"In example above, the urgency level `Low` will not be proposed to requester "
"and the impact level `High` will not be proposed to the technician."

msgid ""
"The **Major** priority used by tickets is not part of the matrix. This level"
" is higher than any other and requires the permission to modify priority in "
"order to be able to assign it. A **Major** incident is a ticket whose "
"processing is of such high importance that it overrides any other ticket."
