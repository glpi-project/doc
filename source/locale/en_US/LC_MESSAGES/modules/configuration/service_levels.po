"There are two types of service level agreements that can be tracked in GLPI."
" - Service Level Agreement (SLA): Agreement between an IT provider and the "
"customer - Operation Level Agreement (OLA): Agreement between "
"groups/departments of the IT provider"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/modules/configuration/service_levels.rst:8
msgid ""
"Both of these types of agreements are used in GLPI to optionally track: - "
"The maximum amount of time that should pass before a ticket has a technician"
" assigned - The maximum amount of time that should pass before a ticket is "
"resolved"

"A calendar can be associated with an SLA/OLA (see :doc:`calendars "
"<dropdowns/calendar>`). By default, no calendar is associated and "
"calculations are done on a working basis 7 days a week and 24 hours a day. "
"It is also possible to use the calendar associated with the ticket (i.e. the"
" one of the entity to which the ticket is attached)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/modules/configuration/service_levels.rst:17
msgid ""
"If the maximum resolution time is expressed in days, all the calculations "
"will be done in days (D+1, D+4 for example) taking into account the calendar"
" to determine the working days. In the use of the End of the working day "
"indicator, the due date will correspond to the end of the corresponding "
"working day. If the maximum resolution time is expressed in hours or "
"minutes, then the calculations will be made taking into account the opening "
"hours."

msgid ""
"For example, for an SLA in H+4 with a calendar defining opening hours from "
"8am to 6pm, a ticket opened at 4pm will have a due date of 10am the next "
"day."

"Changing the ticket to pending status puts the SLA in sleep mode. If the "

msgid ""
"You can automatically assign an SLA or OLA to tickets through the "
":doc:`ticket rules engine <../administration/rules/ticketbusinessrules>`. "
"The association of the SLA with the ticket allows the automatic calculation "
"of its the expiration date. Several SLA/OLAs can thus be defined and "
"assigned according to precise criteria."
msgstr ""

"For example, SLA 1 will be assigned if the ticket is associated to a "
