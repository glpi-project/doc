"**Restrict printer management** When creating a device manually, the user"
" is asked to choose the type of management (unitary or global). A global "
"management only imports an element once, unlike a unitary management "
"which imports it as many times as it is used. For example, a printer "
"shared by several users or a monitor connected to a screen switch. "
"Subsequently, a unitary managed equipment can be switched to global "
"management mode. It is possible to restrict the type of management "
"depending on the equipment."
