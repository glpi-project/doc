"This allows you to track and/or block the presence of duplicate objects "
"based on matching certain fields. For example, you can configure a fields"
" unicity rule for computers using the serial number field. This applies "
"to manual additions and additions made from an external source such as an"
" inventory tool."

"Uniqueness is defined by a name, an object type, and one or more fields. "
"When multiple fields are specified, all of them are checked together "
"instead of individually (Ex: serial number AND UUID match another "
"computer. Uniqueness checks for fields only apply if the field is not "
"empty. For example, multiple computers with a blank serial number would "
"be allowed. Each uniqueness rule has options to refuse the addition of "
"the object and/or send a notification if it is determined to not be "
"unique."
