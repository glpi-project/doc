"This matrix is common to all help desk items (tickets, problems and "

"ITIL best practices separate urgency (as defined by the user) from "
"incident impact (a user, a service, a functionality...) which is usually "
"set by the technician. A matrix is then used to compute the priority "
"associated to the item of the help desk (ticket, problem or change) as a "
"function of both urgency and impact. GLPI provides a default predefined "
"matrix which corresponds to standard cases."

"This predefined matrix can be modified in tab `Assistance` of menu "
"**Setup > General** (see :doc:`Configure general parameters "

"Knowing that the order of items processing by technicians is based on "
"priority, it is possible to select the different levels of urgency, "
"impact or priorities that will be used in the help desk and to disable "
"some of them. This action allows to ease declaration of an incident and "
"its processing. To disable a level, this level must be set to `No`. "
"Medium level cannot be disabled."

"In example above, the urgency level `Low` will not be proposed to "
"requester and the impact level `High` will not be proposed to the "
"technician."

msgid ""
"The **Major** priority used by tickets is not part of the matrix. This "
"level is higher than any other and requires the permission to modify "
"priority in order to be able to assign it. A **Major** incident is a "
"ticket whose processing is of such high importance that it overrides any "
"other ticket."
