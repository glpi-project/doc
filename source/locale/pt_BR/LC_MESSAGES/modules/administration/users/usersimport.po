"This button is available when profile is granted user *External add* "
"authorization. GLPI allows users advanced search in a LDAP directory. The "
"interface is restricted to the list of entities for which GLPI connected "
"user is granted authorization (see :doc:`Administer user profiles "
"</modules/administration/profiles/profiles>`). Once entity is selected (if "
"GLPI is in multi-entities mode or if connected user is granted authorization"
" for several entities), a list of criteria is displayed, based on personal "
"information collected from directory. The search syntax for fields is "
"similar to the syntax of GLPI search engine (see :doc:`Search </first-"
"steps/search>`). Search can be limited to users added or modified in the "
"directory during given time slot by following link *Activate date "

"Simplified interface does not require write authorization for users. An "
