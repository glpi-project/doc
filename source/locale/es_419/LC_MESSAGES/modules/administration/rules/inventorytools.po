"The engine stops at the first matching rule. It is therefore necessary to"
" carefully order the list of rules. In addition, it is preferable to put "
"the rules which are most likely to be verified first, for example for "
"entities containing a lot of assets. The rules for assignment to an "
"entity are only played during the initial import of the machine into "
"GLPI, which means that once a machine is imported, there is no automated "
"process to change its entity and that manual **transfer** must be used."
