"This allows you to track and/or block the presence of duplicate objects "

"Uniqueness is defined by a name, an object type, and one or more fields. "
"When multiple fields are specified, all of them are checked together instead"
" of individually (Ex: serial number AND UUID match another computer. "
"Uniqueness checks for fields only apply if the field is not empty. For "
"example, multiple computers with a blank serial number would be allowed. "
"Each uniqueness rule has options to refuse the addition of the object and/or"
" send a notification if it is determined to not be unique."
