Manage your Preferences
=======================

User preferences are accessible from the `Preferences` tab of the user form by clicking on your name at the top right of the interface, from any page.

Each authenticated user has the possibility to modify his preferences if they have the `Personalize` update right in their profile.

.. note::
   These options override the default ones set in the general setup.
   For more information about the available options refer to the `general setup documentation <../../../modules/configuration/general/default_values.html>`_.

Main Tab
--------

.. image:: images/userprefs-main.png
   :alt: Screen for user form
   :align: center
   :scale: 42%

Here the user can modify the usual personal information:

* Surname
* First name
* Email address
* Phone numbers
* Location
* Language
* ...

.. note::

   Some fields cannot be modified if they come from an LDAP directory.

A user can add email addresses and select the default address, which will be used for sending notifications.

They can also specify some default behaviors of the application, such as the selected profile and entity. They can also turn off notifications for actions they take.

Depending on the profiles, the experienced user can also choose to exit the normal application mode. In debug mode, GLPI displays errors, all variable values, SQL queries, etc. It is useful to activate this mode in the event of GLPI malfunction. A maximum amount of information can therefore be communicated to the developers. This mode also allows you to have additional information on different objects in a specific tab (notifications, etc.).

.. Note:: Note that the Remote access key section allows you to regenerate the security key used to access the private flows offered by GLPI. Currently the ICAL and WEBCAL flows of the planning are protected by this security key which is integrated into the url.

Two-factor authentication Tab
-----------------------------

MFA is now native to GLPI. MFA (or multi-factor authentication) allows you to secure access to your account by means of double authentication.
After entering your password, you'll need to enter the access code provided by your application (Free OTP, Authy, Authenticator, etc.).

- First, you need to download an application like *Authy*,
- Go to your preferences in the top right-hand corner
- Click on my settings > Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Open your auth application
- Click on "+" (or new, add, etc. depending on the application you have chosen) and scan the QR code (if you can't scan the QR code, you can enter the code directly)

- You can also regenerate backup codes (old backup codes will be overwritten)

Personalization Tab

The customisation section breaks down into several parts. In this section, changes are made to the way your interface behaves. You can customise :
