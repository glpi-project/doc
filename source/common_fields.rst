Common fields
=============

Alternate username
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The alternate username is a field returned by the inventory. It is filled in by the user who opened the session on the machine concerned.
This field can be updated if, during the next inventory, another user logs on to the machine.It takes the form ``user@machine_name``. This field can be changed manually,
but it will be locked (by default) to prevent it being updated at a later date. See the article on :doc:`locks`

Inventory number
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Inventory number** is information added manually. It is generally managed internally by the company.

Location
~~~~~~~~

   :alt: module assets - location
   :align: center
   :scale: 50%

You can add location manually or dynamically.

.. warning:: Depending on your needs, pay attention to the entity you are in and its recursivity, so that it is visible or not to other entities.

.. Note:: All locations your created here are available for other GLPI objects depending on the entity in which you created it

To add a location **manually** :

If your have already entered locations :

* Select the one that is right for you in the drop-down list.

If you have not previously entered a location :

* Click on **+**
* In the new box, enter the informations that you need :

  * Name
  * Code
  * As child of
  * Postal code
  * state
  * Building number
  * Longitude
  * Latitude
  * Altitude
  * Comments
  * Aliras
  * Address
  * Town
  * Country
  * Room number

   :scale: 61 %

* Click **+ Add**
* After saving, you can add a new location or close this window
* Now, select the location for your computer


To add a location **automatically** :

You need to create **location rules** to affect a location to a computer. Before, you need to define the criteria which will trigger the rule (a tag inventory, a subnet, a domain, etc.)
In our example, we're going to create a rule that takes the `inventory tag <https://glpi-agent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man/glpi-agent.html#execution-mode-options>`_ into account. If the tag is France, then apply the Paris location

* In **administration > Rules > Location Rules**
* Click **+ Add**
* You can add differents informations (name, logical operator, comments, description, active)
.. Warning:: **Logical operator AND / OR**

   - **"OR"** the rule will then apply from the 1st corresponding criterion. It will ignore all subsequent criteria.
   - **"AND"**, on the other hand, will have to take all the criteria into account for the rule to be applied.
* **Active** your rule
* Clik **+ Add**
* In **Criteria**, click **Add a new criterion**
* Select **Agent > Inventory tag**
* Enter **France**
* Click **+ Add**

.. image:: ../image/add-rule-location-criteria.png
