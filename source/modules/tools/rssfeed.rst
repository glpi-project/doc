Manage RSS feeds
================

GLPI allows to include RSS feeds in tool home page.

A RSS feed is by default personal and therefore only visible by its creator.

For a RSS feed to become public and visible by other users, targets must be added to it, a target being either an entity, a group, a profile or a user.

.. note::
   A public RSS feed is visible by users associated with a profile if this profile has read permission for public RSS feeds.
