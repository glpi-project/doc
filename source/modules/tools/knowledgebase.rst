Manage knowledge base
=====================

GLPI knowledge base has two main targets:

* Gather internal knowledge for technicians;
* Provide information as a public FAQ to enable users to solve simple problems on their own.

.. note::
   Only public FAQ items are visible to users of simplified interface. Other elements are visible only to technicians via standard interface.
   FAQ items are public to everyone (within their entity) that has access to read FAQs. The additional visibility restrictions will have no affect in this case.

Each article of the knowledge base that is not in the FAQ must have one or several targets, a target being either an entity, a group, a profile or a user, to be readable. As long as an article has no target, it is visible only by its writer, is flagged as `unpublished` and appears in table `Unpublished articles` on the home page of the knowledge base.

By default, articles are not translatable. However, this functionality can be activated, see :doc:`general configuration </modules/configuration/general/general_configuration>`.

It is possible to attach documents to articles of the knowledge base.

.. note::
   An article can be made visible during a time slot by defining a start date and an end date.

.. warning::
   Elements which should not be interpreted when displayed can be defined with preformated style (``<pre>`` in HTML). Tags like ``<VirtualHost>`` can therefore be inserted and will be displayed. Other HTML tags (``<TAG>...</TAG>`` may disappear when editing; to have complete visibility of the text, it is possible to switch to HTML mode where all elements will be visible. The browser may also modify dynamically content (case change, tags adding) when editing.
   
It is possible to create categories and sub-categories in order to organize browsing (see :doc:`Configure drop-downs </modules/configuration/intitules/index>`). User can then use several tabs to search and browse knowledge base:

* **Search** 
  This tab is the default tab, displaying recent articles, popular articles and last changes. It allows also to search inside knowledge base.

* **Browse** 
  This tab allows to browse tree structure of categories.

* **Manage** 
  This tab is only visible for knowledge base administrators. Depending on user's permissions, it is possible to access quickly user's articles, user's unpublished articles, all unpublished articles...

.. note::
   The knowledge base search engine provides operators for complex search: ``+ - ~ < > * ” ” ()``.

   * ``+``: word must be there; 
   * ``-``: word must not be there; 
   * ``*``: truncate suffix; 
   * ``" "``: contained sequence must be searched literally;
   * ``< >``: define order on search elements; 
   * ``()``: group when using < and >.

        Examples :

        - printer failure
          -> Search lines containing at least one of these words

        - +printer +failure
          -> Search lines containing both words

        - +mail thunderbird
	  -> Search lines containing word *mail* but rank higher lines containing also word *thunderbird*

        - +mail -outlook
          -> Search lines containing word *mail* but not word *outlook*

        - * +mail +(>thunderbird <outlook)
          -> Search lines containing word *mail* and *thunderbird*, or *mail* and *outlook*, in any order, but rank *mail thunderbird* higher than *mail outlook*

        - open*
	  -> Search lines containing words such as *openoffice*, *openwriter*, *openbar*, *openphp*...

        - "openoffice suite"
          -> Search lines containing exactly sentence *openoffice suite*


The different tabs of an article
--------------------------------

Knowledge base
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tab displays a table with article category, subject, content, writer, creation date, last modification date, number of views and FAQ membership.

If an article is unpublished (i.e. has no target), this information will appear in red above number of views.

Target
~~~~~~

This tab allows to manage article's targets.

An article is by default personal and therefore only visible by its creator.

For an article to become visible by other users, targets must be added to it, a target being either an entity, a group, a profile or a user who will be able to consult the article. 

Edit
~~~~

This tab allows, if appropriate permission, to modify or delete an article.

.. include:: ../tabs/elements.rst

.. include:: ../tabs/documents.rst

.. include:: ../tabs/historical.rst

Revision
~~~~~~~~

This tab allows to consult all article revisions: each saved modification of the article will create a revision storing the previous version of the article.

Revisions can be shown and restored.
