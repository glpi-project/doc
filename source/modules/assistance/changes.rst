Manage changes
==============

A change is a modification of the information system's infrastructure.

A change can be created either from a ticket form or a problem form, in tab **Changes**, or from menu **Assistance > Changes**.

The form to create a change is similar to the ticket creation form and shares with it many terms: *requester*, *watcher*, *assigned to*, *status*, *urgency*, *impact*, *priority*, *category*. For more information see :doc:`Manage tickets </modules/assistance/tickets/ticketmanagement>`. The validation process is also the same as tickets in order to allow preliminary validation of the change (tab *Validations*).

Once the change is created, it is possible to attach tickets but also impacted items (tab *Items*). An analysis phase (tab *Analysis*) consists in describing impacts and controls list in order to implement this change through a deployment plan, a backup plan and a checklist (tab *Plans*).

Same as tickets, task, costs and solution allow to follow and solve the change. For complex changes management, a change can be linked with one or several projects allowing a mode detailed management (:doc:`Manage projects </modules/tools/projects>`).

Changes use their own notifications (see :doc:`Configure email notifications </modules/configuration/04_Notifications/02_Configuration_des_suivis_par_courriels>`).
