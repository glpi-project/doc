.. |addUserLdap| image:: ../images/addUserLdap.png
.. |addUserExt| image:: ../images/addUserExt.png
.. |checkVersion| image:: ../images/checkVersion.png

The 7 standard permissions will not be listed (see :doc:`Permissions description </modules/administration/profiles/profiles>`).

.. warning::

   Some permissions apply globally to GLPI, other permissions may be delegated locally. This is indicated by the color of permissions zones, as described in image below.

   For example, profiles are defined for all entities; on the other hand, business rules may vary from one entity to another.
