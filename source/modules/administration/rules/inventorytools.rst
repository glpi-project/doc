Rules for assigning an item to an entity
----------------------------------------

GLPI has a type of rules that automatically assign an item from an inventory tool to an entity and a location.

A certain number of criteria are available: those containing generic fields (name, description, serial number, domain, IP address, subnet) but also fields coming from the inventory tool if the tool provides them.

The available actions are:

* **ignore import**
* **assign to an entity**
* **assign to an entity using value from regular expression**
* **assign to a location**.

.. warning:: 
   The engine stops at the first matching rule. It is therefore necessary to carefully order the list of rules. In addition, it is preferable to put the rules which are most likely to be verified first, for example for entities containing a lot of assets. The rules for assignment to an entity are only played during the initial import of the machine into GLPI, which means that once a machine is imported, there is no automated process to change its entity and that manual **transfer** must be used.

Using GLPI blacklist mechanism, it is possible to exclude certain values from processing by the rules engine such as certain IP or MAC addresses, for example an IP 127.0.0.1; see :doc:`Blacklists </modules/administration/rules/rulesmanagement>`.

Rules for importing and linking computers
-----------------------------------------

A specific rules engine allows to control the process of importing and binding machines from an inventory tool. This engine defines rules that allow to import, link or refuse computers.

How a computer is imported:

1. computer to be imported pass through the entity assignment engine. If it does not return any entity, then the machine is not imported. Otherwise, the process continues.
2. computer pass through the import and link engine. Depending on the rules, it is either imported into its destination entity, or linked with another present in GLPI, or not imported.

A certain number of criteria are available: generic fields (name, description, serial number, domain, IP address, subnet) but also fields coming from the inventory tool if the tool provides them, the destination entity of the machine as well as a status used to search for a machine already present in GLPI.

The possible actions are to ignore the import, to link it if possible, if not to import it if possible otherwise to refuse the import.

.. warning:: The engine stops at the first matching rule. The search for a machine already present in GLPI is done only in the destination entity of the machine.

.. topic:: Example

   Refuse all imports coming from a precise inventory server:

   .. code-block::

      if inventory server is server1
      then refuse import yes

   Linking machine: 

   .. code-block::

      if machine to import : serial number is already present in GLPI yes AND Lookup computers in GLPI which status is in stock
      then link assign link if possible, else no import

   Refuse a computer because of wrong serial number: 

   .. code-block::

      if machine to import : serial number is "To be Filled By OEM"* 
      then link refuse import yes
