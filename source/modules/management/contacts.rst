Contacts
========

GLPI users are the persons having an authentication for the GLPI application. External persons, usually associated with contracts, are known to GLPI as `Contacts`.

A contact is characterized by usual identity informations as well as title, phone number, mail address... Defining a list of contact types allows to sort contacts by types. It is also possible to export a contact in vCard format.
