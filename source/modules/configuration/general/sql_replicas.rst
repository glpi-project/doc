SQL replicas
============

GLPI can be configured to use replica databases in some cases to improve performance.

This tab is only visible if the option has been enabled in the `system tab <system.html>`_.

To activate the replica management, you just have to fill in the connection parameters.
It is advisable to use a login that has only read privileges on the database.

You can use several replicates by separating them with a comma.
A specific port can also be added.

.. warning::

   If you use multiple replicas, the settings will apply to them all.

The SQL replicas will be used in at least the following cases:

-  The main server cannot be reached.
   In this case, GLPI will switch to read-only mode.
-  Running reports to reduce the load on the main server.

It is also possible to use replicas for the search engine depending on the option chosen.

-  **Never**

-  **If synced (all changes)**
   GLPI will check the synchronization and use the replica if all changes have been replicated.

-  **If synced (current user changes)**
   GLPI will check the synchronization and use the replica if all the changes for the current user have been replicated.
   If using a read-only account, the replica will always be used.

-  **If synced or read-only account**
   GLPI will check the synchronization and use the replica if all changes have been replicated.
   If using a read-only account, the replica will always be used.

-  **Always**

.. warning::

   When always using the replica, it is possible that the results will be out of date.
   A different option should be considered before this one.

.. note::

   The replication configuration of your database is not set by GLPI.
   You still need to configure that with the appropriate tools for your database management system.
