Locations
---------

The list of locations is organized into a tree structure.
Each location can have sub-locations (Location 1 > Sub-location 1 > Sub-sub-location 1).
It can be delegated by entity.

In the record of a location, there is some information about it including:

* The parent location
* Building number
* Room number
* GPS coordinates (longitude, latitude, altitude)
* Street address

If you allow GLPI to use your location, the map displayed when creating a new location will automatically show your approximate location to help make assigning GPS coordinates easier.

Sockets

Lists the network sockets assigned to this location and allows to add a new one.
In this case, when selecting a socket on a network port of a device, only the available network sockets of the device location (and child locations) are shown.
The addition can be single via the top part or multiple via the bottom part. For adding multiple sockets, you can prefix the socket number as shown in the screenshot.
Another example: considering the prefix `bru`, `9` and `11` the socket numbers and `srv` the suffix; the network sockets created will be named: `bru09srv`, `bru10srv` and `bru11srv`.
