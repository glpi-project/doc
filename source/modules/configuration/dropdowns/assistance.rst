Ticket categories
-----------------

The list of ticket categories is tree-like: each element can have sub-elements. It can be delegated by entity.

In the form of a ticket category, you can find some information about this category including but not limited to:

* Responsible and technical group for the automatic assignment of tickets
* Default category of the knowledgebase when you want to add a solution of a ticket
* Visibility of the category depending on the interface (simplified/standard) or object
* Ticket template to use for this category
* Parent category

If a template is chosen, it will be assigned to the choice of the category and will therefore override the one that would have been defined in the entity or via a business rule.

A link with the categories of the knowledge base is possible.
If a category is chosen, clicking on the ticket category help in a ticket leads directly to all the articles in the knowledge base for this category.
