Authorized substitutes
======================

.. versionadded:: 10.1

Substitutes are user accounts that are authorized to act on behalf of an other user to validate or refuse a ticket or a change.

The user can choose one or more accounts to delegate the validation task to. They may optionaly limit the date range of the delegation by setting one or both date limits.

The user may also be a delegatee of another user. In this case, they will see a table of their delegators and the date range of each delegation.
