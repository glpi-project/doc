Debugging information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have `Debug` mode enabled in your preferences, a *Debug* tab will appear before the *All* tab. This tab offers information to help you resolve an issue.

For example, for a computer, you have one or more tables depending on the affected object (financial information, reservations...) listing the notifications that will be triggered on this computer with:

* Triggering event
* Recipient(s)
* Notification model used
* Recipient(s) email address
