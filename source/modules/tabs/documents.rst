Documents
~~~~~~~~~

Additional information is stored in the form of external documents which are files uploaded into GLPI. In the *Documents* tab, documents can be associated and unlinked with the selected item. The :doc:`management of the documents themselves </modules/management/documents>` is dealt with in another chapter.

It is also possible to quickly create a document via this tab by specifying the desired file and optionally the field in which the new document is to be placed. The name of the created document will be based on the name of the added file.

.. note::

   When you delete a document from this tab via mass actions, you only remove the link between the object and the document; the document itself is still present.
