* Type of depreciation: choice of the type of depreciation between linear and declining balance.

* Depreciation coefficient: coefficient applied to a straight-line depreciation type in order to obtain the values of the declining balance type. It is therefore only used if the type of depreciation is declining balance.

Warranty information

Tips
^^^^

GLPI allows you to configure a notification on the expiry of the hardware warranty. This is configurable by entity in :ref:`notification management <notification management>` to define the models and recipients used and in :ref:`the administration of entities <administration-entities>` to enable or disable this feature, define the default values and anticipate the sending of the notification if necessary.

GLPI can perform a simple net book value calculation based on straight-line or declining balance depreciation. To do so, a certain amount of information (value, date, etc.) must be entered.
The user must also enter the date of the financial year the general configuration.

The display of financial information for each type of equipment depends on the profile of the user logged in.
