Associated External Links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *External links* tab is used to show associated external links.

For some items, external links are managed from the menu **Setup > External links**.

These links can use object fields such as IP, name, etc. See :doc:`Configure protocol external links </modules/configuration/external_links>`.

Examples:

* A web link: http://192.168.0.1 (IP retrieved from the network port of the hardware) ;
* A RDP link for remote access: glpi://MSTSC.EXE,pc001 (name "pc001" retrieved from the hardware).
