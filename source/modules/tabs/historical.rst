History
-------

The *History* tab is used to show any changes made to an item. The following information about the changes is available:

* ID of the change.
* Date and time the change was made.
* User who made the change. If this field is not filled, it means that the action was done automatically (For example: automatic inventory update).
* Field that was changed.
* Description of the change that was made.

The description of the change represents either the difference between the old and the new value (For example with location field: Change HQ to Remote Office A), or the explanation of the action which was carried out (For example: Uninstallation of a software: "Gimp 2.0").

.. note::

   For dropdowns or objects with a parent/child relationship, the modification of a child will appear in the history of the parent element.
