Connections

This tab allows to manage the direct connections between a computer and its connected elements.

Direct connections represent the relation between different hardwares linked either physically or virtually.


From a computer

The connection can be made toward one or several elements of type
display, printer, peripheral or phone. For each type of connected
object, its name, serial number and inventory number are displayed.

If this case, the connection can only be made to a single computer. The
table will list the name of this computer as well as its serial and
inventory numbers.

   The deletion of a connection can be made from the entry of each connected hardware (tab `Connections`) via mass actions.

.. note::

   Every deletion or addition of a connection is recorded in the history of the computer.

.. note::

   If using native inventory or third-party inventory tool, the connections informations can be automatically imported and updated.
