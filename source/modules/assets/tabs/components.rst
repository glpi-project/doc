To act on several components (for example modify an element of the
component, activate accounting information or modify them, delete a
component...), first select the components and then use the `Actions`
button present at the top or the bottom of the list.

If several types of different components, not having the same
characteristics, are selected for modification, in the actions it will
be asked on which component modification must be applied.
