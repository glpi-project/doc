Peripherals
===========

In a peripheral form, the following information is available:

* General characteristics of the peripheral:

  * Vendor
  * Model
  * Type
  * Serial number
  * ...

* Peripheral management:

  * Technical person in charge
  * Status
  * Location
  * ...

* Peripheral users:

  * Users known to GLPI or not
  * Groups of users
  * ...

**Management type:**

It is possible to manage peripherals either unitary or globally.

Unitary management corresponds to one peripheral per computer while global management make the peripheral a virtual global element that will be connected to several computers.

Global management allows to limit the number of elements to manage when these elements are not a strategic data in the assets management.

It is possible to use :doc:`templates with peripherals <../generalites/gabarits>`.
