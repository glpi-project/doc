GLPI User Documentation
=======================

.. warning::

   The documentation is being rewritten. It is very likely that some parts are outdated, that there are dead links, etc

Preface
-------

This documentation covers the installation and use of GLPI (Gestion Libre de Parc Informatique) !

Free and open-source solution for IT asset management and helpdesk, and more. GLPI is a web application designed to manage all of your IT asset management issues from inventory management of hardware components and software to the management of user assistance.

This guide is intended to give an overview of GLPI for both administrators and users.

Each part can be consulted independently even if for reasons of logic we recommend that you read this documentation entirely.

Installation
