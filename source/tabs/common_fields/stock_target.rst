Stock target
------------


This option allows you to define an inventory management threshold:

This allows you to specify the ideal minimum quantity you want to keep in your inventory.
If the actual stock falls below this threshold, this can trigger notifications, depending on your configuration.

Administrators can easily monitor if stock falls below the target stock and plan purchases accordingly.

Example:
When a cartridge is created or configured in GLPI, you can set this minimum unit value, for example 10.
GLPI then compares the current stock with the target stock.
If the current stock is lower than the target stock, GLPI generates an alert.
