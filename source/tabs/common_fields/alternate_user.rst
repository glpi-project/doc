Alternate username
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The alternate username is a field returned by the inventory. It is filled in by the user who opened the session on the machine concerned.
This field can be updated if, during the next inventory, another user logs on to the machine.It takes the form ``user@machine_name``. This field can be changed manually,
but it will be locked (by default) to prevent it being updated at a later date. See the article on :doc:`locks`
