GLPI Status Monitoring
----------------------

GLPI contains a helpful endpoint for monitoring its health at `/status.php` and the `glpi:system:status` CLI command.
The `/status.php` endpoint does not require you to be logged in and therefore only shows basic status information.
Sensitive information like the GLPI version and plugin names and versions (could be used to identify vulnerabilities) are not shown.
Information from the PHP script and the CLI command is presented as JSON.
The difference with the CLI command though is that since it isn't accessible from the web, you can optionally retrieve private information too.

Services
~~~~~~~~

The status of GLPI is separated into multiple "services". These services can be listed using the `glpi:system:list_services` CLI command.

A non exhaustive list of services available:
 - db - Database (Main and replicants)
 - cas - Central Authentication Server
 - ldap - LDAP/Active Directory
 - imap - Email Server(s)
 - mail_collectors - Email collectors
 - crontasks - Automatic actions
 - filesystem - Filesystem access
 - plugins - Plugins status

Status Endpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can filter the output to a specific service using the `service` query parameter.

CLI Command
~~~~~~~~~~~

Similar to the `/status.php` endpoint, the CLI command `glpi:system:status` only shows the public status information by default.
However, since this tool is not available from the web interface, you may add the `-p` or `--private` option to see all of the status information.

You can filter the output to a specific service using the `-s` or `--service` option.
