Ticket tasks, characteristics and use

A task is an action corresponding to a technical intervention related to
a ticket.

A task can have a category (see [Configurer les
intitulés](config_dropdown.html "Les intitulés se configurent depuis le menu Configuration > Intitulés")).

A task can be private or public.

A task can be assign to a technician.

A private task is only visible: :

-   its editor
-   technician to whom the task was assigned
-   users with the right
    `See assigned tickets (personnal + group associated)`.

The length allows the documentation by the technician for the actual
processing of the task, most notably in statistics or billings.

Finally, a task is schedulable. Once defined, the start date, duration
or end date input, the task will appear on planning calendar of the
technician to whom the task was assigned. The status can report the
state of the task (**Information, To do, Done**).

Note: To schedule a task more easily, it is possible to check the
availability of the technicians. The icon

summary of open periods.

Note: It is possible to set a reminder for the task before it starts by
defining a time interval for the reminder. Notifications must be enabled
(see [Configure
Notifications](config_notification.html "Notifications are configured from the menu Setup > Notifications ;")).
